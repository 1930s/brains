You’ve probably heard someone say “I’m not really a creative type…”? When people say that, it’s quite rarely a positive thing. They might mean that they are not artistic, but usually the message is that this person has given up on being creative in all the ways possible.

I think creativity is closely related to critical thinking or more specifically the courage to think for yourself.

Often this puts you at a disadvantage because it's so much easier to consume and regurgitate established knowledge. However only doing this means you have less practice thinking for yourself than those who were stubborn enough to resist and so at the cutting edge cannot contribute much.

It's not just lack of practice, it's more lack of courage because you are used to being right and smart.

But, being creative is just to have courage to think different and being wrong.

Like a child.
