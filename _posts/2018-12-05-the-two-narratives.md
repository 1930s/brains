Thiel believes in determinate optimisim: the future is made by exceptional people who have a definite plan and execute on it. That meaningful, big-leap innovations are often not obvious from the start: If you're creating something that will be a great company 10 years from now, most people will probably not get it at first. Just see the Airbnb's 7 Rejections from investors as evidence.

In other words: Founders who want to create radical innovation should have a big, audacious plan and ignore mundane thinking.


The (misunderstood) Lean Startup dogma is to have no definite plan, work in incremental iterations to find out what's most valuable to customers today. This approach will probably lead you to very incremental solutions, or even make you run around in circles achieving nothing. It lowers the cost of failure, but also the potential impact of success. Process becomes more important than the end goal. It's literally the opposite of what Peter propagates. He has indeed expressed his dislike for this approach.


## Run Faster or Jump Higher

3. Steve Blank doesn't advertise this type of lean though, as he repeatedly said that "entrepreneurship is part art, part science" - that founders should have a goal on the horizon, a vision, and then validate parts of that vision along the way. Note that Thiel advises starting small with an offering that can monopolize a small market, then grow the eventual company out of that. Sounds a bit like a business model MVP, doesn't it?

Thiel's logic works well in long-term view: finding a frontier of value which will be a great company years from now. A frontier that only a few people believe exists (but you have strong proof and conviction that it does). 

Blank's Logic (actually rooted in Design Thinking and IDEO) is a ground-level method to improve your evolving value proposition and  business model. They are not opposites - just slightly different views on different "zoom levels" of the same thing.
