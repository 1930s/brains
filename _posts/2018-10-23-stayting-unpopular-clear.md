## Digging beyond the surface-level masks we wear

Blaise Pascal: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”

Information technologies have dominated our cultural direction. From the telephone to the radio to the TV to the Mobile internet, we have found ways to bring us all closer together, enabling constant worldly access.

We now live in a world where we’re connected to everything except ourselves. If Pascal’s observation about our inability to sit quietly in a room by ourselves is true of the human condition in general, then the issue has certainly been augmented by an order of magnitude due to the options available today.

The less comfortable you are with solitude, the more likely it is that you won’t know yourself. And then, you’ll spend even more time avoiding it to focus elsewhere. In the process, you’ll become addicted to the same technologies that were meant to set you free.

Just because we can use the noise of the world to block out the discomfort of dealing with ourselves doesn’t mean that this discomfort goes away.

Almost everybody thinks of themselves as self-aware. They think they know how they feel and what they want and what their problems are. But the truth is that very few people really do. And those that do will be the first to tell how fickle self-awareness is and how much alone time it takes to get there.

In today’s world, people can go their whole lives without truly digging beyond the surface-level masks they wear; in fact, many do.

We are increasingly out of touch with who we are, and that’s a problem.


## It's Not About Being Happy

I don't think the purpose of life is is to be happy. Happiness, as associated with pleasure, Isn't enough and it fades. Struggle and pain are necessary for a good life: Staying in the truth. Without them, we don't grow, and we cease to face reality.

A better goal is to create a framework/model in which you constantly define what it means to know the world better tomorrow than you are today. There is one thing people always ignore is our environment controls far more of behavior than we imagine. Creating better thinking frameworks and thinking patterns helps you to mentally shaping your surroundings.

It's all about stay standing in the truth.


## The Truth = Clear

While we often think of the reality we observe as being objective, the truth is actually that the objective and the subjective very much overlap in how we view things and how we feel about them. Everything that you call reality is something you have developed a subjective emotional response to.

When you look at a piece of clothing or a computer or food, you’re not just seeing what’s there. Your judgment of your observation is also being influenced by the feelings you’ve developed towards them over time.

One of the things that we all take for granted is the general definition of truth. We associate truth with the daily cause and effect relationships that we observe in our lives. In a sense, many of them are true. Without diving too deep into philosophy, there is such a thing as a contextual truth.

That said, when it comes to seeing reality for what it really is, beyond specific contexts confined by the language we use to interact with each other, then it’s fairly evident that we don’t — at least currently — see the world as it really is, which is why the objective and the subjective overlap.
Humans are not programmed for truth. They are programmed for survival.

There are smells around that we physically can’t smell, there are sights to witness beyond the wavelength that our eyes operate in, and there are sounds to be heard that we will never fully hear.
The reason for this is that these things aren’t required for us to pass on our genes.

The environments that we adapted to didn’t need us to be able to see like a snake might be able to or to sniff to the extent that a dog can.

Everything we take for granted as reality is, in fact, an illusion of sorts. There may be an objective component to what we see, but much of that objectivity is limited. Further yet, a lot of it is clouded by our subjective judgments.

We’re each shaped by our own interactions with reality, and that’s why something that you see as extended suffering would not have evoked the same reaction from another person.
That person had literally conditioned himself to experience a different world.

In the words of Albert Camus: “The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.”

You can condition yourself to reject a big part of an unfavorable reality by amalgamating it with a more favorable perception. In the process of doing so, you gain complete power and control over your world.

Reality is as much real as it is a figment of our imagination. There is nothing you have to fear if you know that it can be rebelled against. You are not your circumstances, just like you are not your past.

That, to me, is the most liberating fact of existence.
