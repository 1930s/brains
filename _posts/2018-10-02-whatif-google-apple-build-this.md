I'm always wondering why Yahoo didn't build a search engine in 1998, or why Dropbox is better than Google Drive. The truth is that ___ is a small market for Apple or Google for now. If they start to take ___ seriously, then the ___ market is already big enough to allow multiple players to exist. Or, they did create a product for ___ , but in the wrong direction.

These big companies seem to have infinite resources and they seem to be able to build anything and crash anyone. The question is, should they? The fact is, if a project is not on the top priority list of their decision maker, then they would just send a B team, or C team to work on the project. So usually, small startups are not competing with the big company. They are competing with B team or C team inside the big company. 

And, most important of all, themseleves.
