Should you make your product perfect or get it out there? Launch and iterate.

You want entrepreneurs who are “all in.” 
 
The best entrepreneurs are not driven by money—they’re driven by mission and a sense of purpose larger than the individual.

Our top investment in each fund is roughly worth more than all of the other investments in that fund combined. It’s not exact, but it is way more top-heavy than people would guess. This can be described by a power law, which measures the relationship between an event frequency and the magnitude of the event. I believe that you can apply that law to your personal life—for example, how you spend your time follows a power law. One thing you’re doing in your day is probably more valuable than all the other tasks combined. One person in your life is likely more important than all the other people combined. I don’t think people have thought about their personal lives like this, but what it basically means is that you shouldn’t spread yourself too thin. Figure out the most important thing and focus your energy on it.
