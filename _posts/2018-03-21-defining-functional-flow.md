In Functional Flow theory, building a functional flow system is all about two stages: 

* Clearity and Efficiency 

* Flow and Composition


## A Clear and Efficient Machine 

We need to see things purely.


#### Being Clear

> The most basic definition of clearity is:
> 
> The clearity between input and output.


Back to 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci simply watched, noted, and contextualized things as he saw fit. It wasn’t like he was intentionally studying science one day and art another. To him, they were one and the same thing. They danced together, and it wasn’t possible to understand one without the other.


#### Being Efficient

> The most basic definition of efficiency is:
> 
> The ratio between input and output.

In the book < The systems approach, Dell Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1968 >, we can view an organization as a organic sysyem, instead of blindly following the traditional lines of division the management scientist turns to basic "missions" or "jobs" or "activities". 

All these three terms are used to describe the same kind of thing, namely, the rational breakdown of the tasks the system must perform. This is a mission-oriented view of the components of a system that is completely different from the traditional view. 

#### Clear(Efficiency)= Machine X

Clear efficiency is looking around one's functional flow to discover if, and in that case - where? when? Why-, inefficiency occur. These inefficiency can be for example idle inventory, idle men or idle equipment. A good manager should then do his best to eliminate these inefficiency. All of this in order to reduce the total cost of operations of the functional flow system.

The philosophy behind the efficiency approach to functional flow is based the idea of "the one best way for yourself", i.e., the best way to input information, compute functions, perform tasks, output value as a balanced human being.

If you time every single step and motion, and then carefully design the steps of the task to minimize the time, the system will perform in the best possible way.

This approach leads toward automation of the operations. If we know the optimal way, the only way, we also know how to design a machine or robot to perform the same task. 

Some humanists may be horrified by this, fearing the result will be degradation of one' human dignity and neglect of deeper human values.

I will explan why "flow" and "compostion" will easily ease these concerns later. 
Just like the way Leonardo da Vinci see how the world works: Dancing together.

## A Composiable Flow


We need to see things purely, as function compostion.

#### Machine (Composiable Flow) = Functional Flow

> Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.

Although the word "function" has been defined in many ways, everyone will agree that a function can be a set of functions coordinated to output a set of value. 

Flow state isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Functional Flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function. You can view another person's functions (thinking models, paths...) as the input of your function (also the input of other people's function), then take that function's output value as your input again.


In some way, you can say it's like composing people’s thinking models(including yours) and iterate it like a machine.

Functional Flow is all about composing and iterating like ghosts in a shell. 

Ghosts as a whole under a shell.
