Ghost in the Shell (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊 Hepburn: Kōkaku Kidōtai, "Mobile Armored Riot Police") is a 1989 Japanese media franchise originally published as a seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow. 

In that post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg. -Wiki

No doubt, we are still way far from that advanced tech now, though we are slowly becoming the cyborg with a supercomputer in our pocket. 

Inspired by Ghost in the Shell, I think we should try to turn our brain into composable and functional brains by starting to view everything as a function, and iterate it like a machine. So we can solve the information/signal overload in this digital age, . 

I believe the future of human thinking is to decentralize ourselves. Like Ghosts in the Shell, as a whole.


# Defining Functional Flow

In Functional Flow theory, building a functional flow system is all about two stages: 

* Clearity and Efficiency 

* Flow and Composition


## Fisrt: A Clear and Efficient Machine 


We need to see things purely.


#### Being Clear

> The most basic definition of clearity is:
> 
> The clearity between input and output.


Back to 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci simply watched, noted, and contextualized things as he saw fit. It wasn’t like he was intentionally studying science one day and art another. To him, they were one and the same thing. They danced together, and it wasn’t possible to understand one without the other.


#### Being Efficient


> The most basic definition of efficiency is:
> 
> The ratio between input and output.

In the book < The systems approach, Dell Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1968 >, we can view an organization as a organic sysyem, instead of blindly following the traditional lines of division the management scientist turns to basic "missions" or "jobs" or "activities". 

All these three terms are used to describe the same kind of thing, namely, the rational breakdown of the tasks the system must perform. This is a mission-oriented view of the components of a system that is completely different from the traditional view. 

#### Clear(Efficiency)= Machine X


Clear efficiency is looking around one's functional flow to discover if, and in that case - where? when? Why-, inefficiency occur. These inefficiency can be for example idle idea(output), idle information(input) or idle functions. A good functional flow owner should then do his/her/their best to eliminate these inefficiency. All of this in order to reduce the total cost of operations of the functional flow system.

The philosophy behind the efficiency approach to functional flow is based the idea of "the one best way for yourself", i.e., the best way to input information, compute functions, perform tasks, output value as a balanced human being.

If you time every single step and motion, and then carefully design the steps of the task to minimize the time, the system will perform in the best possible way.

This approach leads toward automation of the operations. If we know the optimal way, the only way, we also know how to design a machine or robot to perform the same task. 

Some humanists may be horrified by this, fearing the result will be degradation of one' human dignity and neglect of deeper human values.

I will explan why "flow" and "compostion" will easily ease those concerns later. 

Just like the way Leonardo da Vinci see how the world works: They are dancing together.

## Second: A Composiable Flow in the Shell


We need to see things purely, as function compostion.

> The ratio of function composition between input and output.

#### Machine (Composiable Flow) = Functional Flow

> Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.

Although the word "function" has been defined in many ways, everyone will agree that a function can be a set of functions coordinated to output a set of value. 

Flow state isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Functional Flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function. You can view another person's functions (thinking models, paths...) as the input of your function (also could be the input of other people's function). If you want to, after composing, you can also take that as your input again.

In some way, you can say it's like composing people’s thinking models(including yours) and iterate it like a machine.

That's why Functional Flow is all about composing and iterating like ghosts in a shell. 

Ghosts as a whole under a powerfull shell.
