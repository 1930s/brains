# Brian Singerman(GM)'s Philosophy

> Founders Fund is no stranger to controversy. Early on, it declared itself the VC firm for entrepreneurs who didn't like other VCs.
> 
> "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."
> 
> "There are very few VCs out there with that ability to identify and go large in what will be great companies."

- How Brian Singerman Became Founders Fund's Top VC


> "I want to be involved with the world’s most important companies. Just find and invest in the world’s most important companies and the returns will follow."
> 
> "If you actually can develop and manufacture an efficacious drug in oncology that’s worth a lot as-is. Whereas in the IT space, it’s not enough just to have a cool piece of technology ... there’s all this other risk associated with it.
> 
> So a lot of Silicon Valley venture is willing to take that business risk, but I’m not sure one is riskier or not riskier than the other."

>  “I really want to be doing something more interesting than this.” And I met up with the Founders Fund guys.
> 
> "They hadn’t made the investment, but were considering this crazy investment in something called SpaceX, and I was like, “Oh I want to be part of stuff like this.” And so I came on board, specifically, because SpaceX didn’t need a $50k check, SpaceX needed a real check. And I wanted to be part of that. That to me was an example of a world changing company. That is one of the most important companies on the planet. I came on board because I wanted to do stuff like that."

> "We are looking for anything that can be the most important company on the planet. Maybe something in the early days doesn’t look like it, maybe it looks like it later."
> 
> "..we have a ruthless focus on finding the most important companies on the planet. The reason we have a large fund is so we can write big checks. Not only are we sector agnostic, we’re stage agnostic. We invest in a company once we see it can be one of the most important companies on the planet. We came into Airbnb at the $2.5 billion round. Not the $5 m round. But when we do see that what differentiates us is we go big."
> 
> "The key to the strategy once we have conviction we are willing to invest a lot. So with Stemcentrx, over the multiple rounds of this company, we invested something like $300 million. It’s not enough to think something is going to be one of the most important companies on the planet you have to back it up. So, to me, venture capital is about having conviction and putting a lot of money behind it."
> 
> "We back the truck up when we have conviction."
> 
> "[Sean Parker] is a phenomenal pro-active venture capitalist. I am not a proactive venture capitalist. I am a reactive venture capitalist. I think I’m an excellent reactive venture capitalist. And I think in order to be truly, truly, truly sector agnostic, you have to be reactive."
