# From Founders Fund's Partner: Ken Howery


You want entrepreneurs who are “all in.”

The best entrepreneurs are not driven by money—they’re driven by mission and a sense of purpose larger than the individual.

Our top investment in each fund is roughly worth more than all of the other investments in that fund combined. It’s not exact, but it is way more top-heavy than people would guess. This can be described by a power law, which measures the relationship between an event frequency and the magnitude of the event. I believe that you can apply that law to your personal life—for example, how you spend your time follows a power law. One thing you’re doing in your day is probably more valuable than all the other tasks combined. One person in your life is likely more important than all the other people combined. I don’t think people have thought about their personal lives like this, but what it basically means is that you shouldn’t spread yourself too thin. Figure out the most important thing and focus your energy on it.

### From "How Brian Singerman Became Founders Fund's Top VC"

Founders Fund is no stranger to controversy. Early on, it declared itself the VC firm for entrepreneurs who didn't like other VCs.
 
"We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."
 
"There are very few VCs out there with that ability to identify and go large in what will be great companies."


### From "Brian Singerman made Founders Fund’s biggest return ever"

"I want to be involved with the world’s most important companies. Just find and invest in the world’s most important companies and the returns will follow."

“...I really want to be doing something more interesting than this.” And I met up with the Founders Fund guys. They hadn’t made the investment, but were considering this crazy investment in something called SpaceX, and I was like, “Oh I want to be part of stuff like this.” And so I came on board, specifically, because SpaceX didn’t need a $50k check, SpaceX needed a real check. And I wanted to be part of that. That to me was an example of a world changing company. That is one of the most important companies on the planet. I came on board because I wanted to do stuff like that."

"We are looking for anything that can be the most important company on the planet. Maybe something in the early days doesn’t look like it, maybe it looks like it later."
 
"..We have a ruthless focus on finding the most important companies on the planet. The reason we have a large fund is so we can write big checks. Not only are we sector agnostic, we’re stage agnostic. We invest in a company once we see it can be one of the most important companies on the planet. We came into Airbnb at the $2.5 billion round. Not the $5 m round. But when we do see that what differentiates us is we go big."
 
"The key to the strategy once we have conviction we are willing to invest a lot. So with Stemcentrx, over the multiple rounds of this company, we invested something like $300 million. It’s not enough to think something is going to be one of the most important companies on the planet you have to back it up. So, to me, venture capital is about having conviction and putting a lot of money behind it."
 
"We back the truck up when we have conviction."
 
"[Sean Parker] is a phenomenal pro-active venture capitalist. I am not a proactive venture capitalist. I am a reactive venture capitalist. I think I’m an excellent reactive venture capitalist. And I think in order to be truly, truly, truly sector agnostic, you have to be reactive."

1/ Often, we’re the first money in or very early after angel rounds, and sometimes we’re doing those financings on our own or doing the bulk of them.-SN

2/ We’re only interested in things that offer some very unique, differentiated angle.-AV

3/ At Founders Fund we avoid investing in companies unless they are consuming cash. We're here to invest when doing so will bring about positive progress faster, which often manifests as the conversion of cash into assets and increased burn. Cash-flow-positive businesses are usually past this inflection point, or simply don't have enough ideas about what valuable things to do with more money.-SN

4/ Algebraic equation to represent the ideal amount of money a company should be spending: 
 Burn rate [$/month] = Milestones/Month x Cost/Milestone = Speed/Efficiency 
 
 Looking for companies that are spending money to reach an R&D milestone never achieved before."The most valuable, important companies of the decades ahead are building the future today, executing quickly and burning money in the process."-SN

# Founders feedback

They led our (largish) seed round. Had a slightly negative experience with one partner, but the median person we worked with beat most firms we talked to in first principles thinking by quite a margin. They were all very bright and had a wide range of knowledge.

They were far less interested in "who else is in" and more interested in your analysis of your business from basic building blocks.

When we were doing due diligence on them, the main "complaint" we heard from people who had raised from them is that it's hard to read their judgement. They may seem bearish on you then invest last minute or the opposite. Most people had great things to say though.

Hope this is helpful for anyone considering talking to them.-[HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11374180)
