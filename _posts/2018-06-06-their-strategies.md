Before divein to Apple's Audio Strategy, I want to talk a bit about strategies and business models in big tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.


### Facebook Loop

Facebook and Google are data companies focused on offering free, data-capturing services to as many users as possible. The business models are dependent on achieving scale in order to access as much data as possible.

That's why FB launch [Tinder-like platform](https://www.recode.net/2018/5/6/17321108/facebook-online-dating-service-explained-no-ads) this month, so they can keep people staying on the "Facebook Universe". 



### Amazon Loop
 
Amazon is a retail platform company focused on getting you to buy more stuff over time. Scale in terms of purchase volume is needed in order for the cash flow/reinvestment cycle to continue.

> Lower Prices > More Customers > Alexa > More Services/Buy > More Data > More Customer behavoir > Money > Lower Tech Cost > Loop

### Apple Loop

Apple is a design company focused on selling tools capable of fostering superior and "seamless" experiences. Scale is considered a byproduct of a properly functioning business model.

> Device as a hub > App Store Shopping > More Seamless devices > App Store Shopping/ Services > New Device per year > Money
