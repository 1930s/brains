Humans are not programmed for truth. They are programmed for survival.

There are smells around that we physically can’t smell, there are sights to witness beyond the wavelength that our eyes operate in, and there are sounds to be heard that we will never fully hear.

The reason for this is that these things aren’t required for us to pass on our genes. The environments that we adapted to didn’t need us to be able to see like a snake might be able to or to sniff to the extent that a dog can.

Everything we take for granted as reality is, in fact, an illusion of sorts. There may be an objective component to what we see, but much of that objectivity is limited. Further yet, a lot of it is clouded by our subjective judgments.

We’re each shaped by our own interactions with reality, and that’s why something that you see as extended suffering would not have evoked the same reaction from other people.
