China’s ruling Communist Party has proposed scrapping term limits for the country’s president earlier today, appearing to lay the groundwork for party leader Xi Jinping to rule as president beyond 2023. The planned constitutional change allows Xi to hold power indefinitely. As you can see, Xi has already grasped more power more quickly than his two recent predecessors.

The world must now come to terms with China's most powerful leader in decades, perhaps for decades to come. And China is accumulating ever greater international influence, increasingly pitting its own political system against western democracies, and pursuing the so-called "Chinese Dream" to build a more prosperous and glorious future.

Ironically, with the rise of Bitcon, the world order that we’re in is undergoing a profound adjustment to more centralized ecosystems. 

Both capitalism and communism have decentralized voluntaryism, but both ideals corrupt in practice to centralized rent-seeking and use of lethal force. The world was never so much about ideal distribution of resources, as it was about the centralized use of force vs a decentralized voluntary trade and resilience to such force. 

So what do we do? I believe that the future of Internet and blockchain tech is the best chance of decentralized power we've had in past 1000 years since Song dynasty.
