We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. 

But we lost all that. We've forgotten that we are still pioneers. 

And we've barely begun. -Interstellar(2014)
