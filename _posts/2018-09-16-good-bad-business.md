## Good biz:

```

1) subscription revenue 
2) targets fear/insecurity 
3) high ltv of customer
4) outsourced customer service
5) minimal content creation

```

## Bad biz:

```

1) one time sales
2) no repeat customers
3) content creation
4) reliance on ads 
5) no organic traffic

```


If all of your ideas are accepted, youâ€™re not taking enough risk.
