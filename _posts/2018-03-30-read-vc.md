# Upside

> Success in VC is purely about upside maximization. Downside minimisation is unimportant. - [Brian Singerman](http://www.thetwentyminutevc.com/briansingerman/)

# Prediction

> The predictions that matter are those with a large payoff and little costs. 

> If you predict what other people are predicting, you get nothing (but a nice paper track record). Monoculture works for blabbering academics, not traders & people in the real world.

> For instance, for a linear payoff, if you predict an event priced at 1% probability, you can be wrong 99% of the time.

> For the same probability w/ a convex payoff, you can be wrong 999 times out of 1000 and still do very well.


> You can be wrong on a lot of decisions if you are really right on a few huge ones.  Optimize for the magnitude of your good decisions, not the percentage of the time you are right. -[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/975278242478338049)
