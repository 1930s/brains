Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. 

Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

Ignore people playing status games. 

You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.

Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.
