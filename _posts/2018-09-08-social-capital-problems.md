How Social Capital's experiment could work? (from the CEO of SC's speech) 

1. More SaaS products like using Stripe for payments, AppAnnie, etc. can audit and monitor revenue.

2. Small, seed stage investments up to 250k and placing a lot of bets.

3. Companies could apply online allowing for startups in non-traditional and underserved areas like Mexico City to receive funding. Ditto as well for removing potential human biases like founder gender, race, etc.

I don't believe he ever proposed using a completely data driven decision for a $200M Series C round. Personally, it seems like an unfortunate situation as I like when someone undertakes a new approach to an old problem, but it sounds like he stopped showing up to do the work needed for this to happen.


Index funds have beaten most active management over the long run. If you think about it, YC is a huge index fund in startups. The problem is not data-based prediction - just that it is impossible to pick winners a priori, no matter how much data you have. Ergo the clearly viable long run strategy is to invest in as many as you can. This is why YC is maximizing volume, with the latest being the Startup School.
The other option of course is to invest large amounts into startups that are well on their way, but Sequoia and AH have a corner on that market. And now YC wants to play there as well, with their larger fund.

So there's no oxygen left for a lot of the VC firms in the valley. There's no shortage of money looking for VC funds, as returns are low in general asset classes. So you have this imbalanced situation, where dinky startups get incredible valuations, and there are too few genuine investment opportunities to go around. SC are one of the marquee victims, but other walking dead abound, though they dress snappy so it's hard to tell they're really dead.

The issues outlined here seems to led to an even worse problem: the experience of founders pitching to them was poor (Deal Flow).
