1/ We carefully produce images of ourselves that are supposed to reflect our personalities, our inner selves.

2/ On Social Media, you can see how the pressure to perfect, fill, and define faces has constricted facial expression, and therefore the expression of emotion. As if these faces are trying to transcend their personhood, turn themselves into a flawless famous personified brand.

3/ Artificial personalities have become the benchmark, professionalized, weaponized bodies with personalities to match.

4/ Our bodies are the never finished product, always under constant production.

* Inspired by Alexandra Kleeman
