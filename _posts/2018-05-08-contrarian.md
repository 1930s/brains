Contrarian thinking isn't about being contrary. It's about recognising that rather often when everyone thinks alike nobody is actually thinking.

And being a contrarian is about noticing and about integrating what you notice with the rest of what you know.

Contrarian thinking is just seeing clearly and thinking clearly and having the courage to trust your own judgement even when it is at odds with the consensus view.
