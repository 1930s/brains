## Bubble? What bubble?
Why are there so many people who seem to be invested in the idea that there is a bubble and it is going to pop? Well, if you believe the bubble would come in the near future, you might be disappointed.

Just because some people are hating the unicorns of Silicon Valley and the culture they breed doesn’t mean we are in another tech bubble again. For at least the last 3, nearly 4 years we’ve been warned that next year the bubble will pop. But, ironically, it seems that people who are spreading the thoughts that there is a bubble coming soon don’t even understand what ‘bubble’ mean.

The fact is that any generation of smart people will be drawn to where the money is, from Wall Street giants like Goldman and Blackstone to tech startups like Uber and Airbnb. Right now, it’s Silicon Valley generation. They are the new Wall Street, but without bubble part.

## Okay, what does bubble actually mean?

There are few definitions from textbook:

A surge in equity prices, often more than warranted by the fundamentals and usually in a particular sector, followed by a drastic drop in prices as a massive selloff occurs.
A theory that security prices rise above their true value and will continue to do so until prices go into free fall and the bubble bursts. (Investopedia)
I define a bubble as something where assets have prices that cannot be justified with any reasonable assumption. (Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business Administration who studies valuation and IPOs.) (Inc.)
Generally, a bubble implies a systemic problem and an existential danger. The prices rise above their true value and crash the open market someday. Then people will lose their money.

So, let’s think about this :

Can those Silicon Valley unicorns crash the market and cause systemic danger? ( Will normal people be affected?)

Some say there is a tech bubble coming
VC and media stars :

1. “Arguing we aren’t in a bubble because it’s not as bad as 1999,” Gurley tweeted, “is like saying that Kim Jong-un is fine because he’s not as bad as Hitler.” — Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark Capital.
2. “The biggest of all losers will be anyone who has borrowed money to invest in private companies.” — Mark Cuban
3. Virtually every great bubble bursting has been preceded by an attempt to build the tallest buildings: Glassy Salesforce Tower in SF. — Vikram Mansharamani, a Yale lecturer and author of the book Boombustology
4. Some interns have been paid more than $7,000 a month, which adds up to about $84,000 a year. (The median household income in the United States is around $53,000.) “SF tech culture is focused on solving one problem: What is my mother no longer doing for me?” — Formerly the lead blogger for the New York Times’ bits blog: Nick Bilton

[And an Employee of one of the unicorn startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ulai3/are_we_on_the_verge_of_a_different_tech_bubble/):

MANY of these tech startups do not have stable revenue streams or business models. Airbnb and Uber perhaps do, but there are many others that simply have no idea how they’re going to make money, and are burning through cash like it’s going out of style. Even for those companies like Uber and Snapchat that have some amount of revenue, they’re still in a bubble. Valuing a company at an enormous multiple of revenue or cash flows still equals bubble, even if those companies have “stable revenue.”
VC firms and PE firms raise investment funds not only from the partners of the firms but also from state pensions, retirement funds, mutual funds, etc. We see institutional investors like Fidelity, for example, recently writing down some of the value of their investment in Snapchat.There are billions of $ invested in over 100 unicorns, totaling a $450 billion+ valuation. If most of these unicorns go bust, expect retirement funds and pension funds to take a big hit.



## The truth is…This time is different

### IPO: Lesser and slower

Some overvalued unicorns going down doesn’t mean we are in the tech bubble. As you can see the [chart (from AVC)](http://avc.com/2015/06/two-charts/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=cb_daily&utm_campaign=email) , Series A is still healthy, the ‘overheated’ only happening after Series B. And unicorns are not going IPO like the old times, they are just staying private longer. (Like Palantir)

Are unicorns getting faster?Obviously NO.


### They contribute more than before

[According to Goldman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-06/goldman-there-s-the-huge-difference-between-the-tech-bubble-and-today-s-market), the first chart (below) shows sector composition in the S&P 500 dating back to 1974. The chart points out the energy bubble, tech bubble and most recently the financial bubble. At its peak, tech accounted for roughly a third of the S&P’s market cap. It currently accounts for 21 percent.

Second, take a look at each sector’s contribution to the S&P 500’s total net income. During the tech bubble, tech never accounted for more than 16 percent of total earnings. Today, where it makes up a smaller portion of the S&P 500 sector composition, it contributes 20 percent.

That mean technology is actually contributing a lot to net income this time around.

## No bubble but the party is about to be over

Rounds will be harder to raise, valuation multiples will be lower.
There’s an adjustment happening.
No more easy jobs for people from boot camp.
The investment bubble is being fueled by an “easy money policy” and low-interest rates, which may not last a whole lot longer according to recent economic indicators.
We may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability. (Bill Gurley)
