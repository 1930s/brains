## Define

Intuition is defined as knowing without knowing how you know, that’s the wrong definition. Because by that definition, you cannot have the wrong intuition. It presupposes that we know, and there is really a prejudice in favor of intuition. We like intuitions to be right.

A  better definition — or a more precise one — would be that  intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do. By this definition, the intuition could be right or it could be wrong.

## Confidence Bias

In general, confidence is a very poor cue to accuracy. Because intuitions come to your mind with considerable confidence and there is no guarantee they’re right.

There are certain times when intuition can be correct. For instance, chess players and married couples generally have accurate intuition.

Intuitions of master chess players when they look at the board [and make a move], they’re accurate. Everybody who’s been married could guess their wife’s or their husband’s mood by one word on the telephone. That’s an intuition and it’s generally very good, and very accurate.

However, people who pick stocks in the stock market do not have it. Because, the stock market is not sufficiently regular to support developing that kind of expert intuition.

## A lot of practice and immediate feedback

The second condition for accurate intuition is “a lot of practice”. And the third condition is immediate feedback. You have to know almost immediately whether you got it right or got it wrong.

When those three kinds of conditions are satisfied, people develop expert intuition.

But unless those three conditions are satisfied, the mere fact that you have an idea and nothing else comes to mind and you feel a great deal of confidence — absolutely does not guarantee accuracy.
