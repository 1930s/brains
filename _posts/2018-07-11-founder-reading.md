Do you have product market fit or not? If not, save as much money as you can, spend more time with your customers, and build a product they need.

The best way to control your own destiny as a company is often to make just enough revenue that you can always dial down expenses fast enough (<= 6 mo) to be break even if you get shitty terms or get into bad circumstances.-[Suhail](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1012860530791346177)

In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the sharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be. In practice there is surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends and how fast it grows. When a startup grows fast, it's usually because the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big need straight on. When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because the product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because they're wasteful.


 It's not the product that should be insanely great, but the experience of being your user. The product is just one component of that. For a big company it's necessarily the dominant one. But you can and should give users an insanely great experience with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the difference with attentiveness.-[PG](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)

There are a lot of romantic startup stories about founders who have this brilliant idea, start coding, and in no time at all there are investors knocking at the door touting multimillion dollar valuations. I’m sure this does happen, but it’s probably a lot rarer than we’re led to believe. The media tends to ignore the low-flying companies that never make onto their radar and rightfully so. The companies that do become successful get a lot of attention, creating the impression for the naïve that the numbers are better than they actually are. I learned later that this is known as the survirorship bias. -[ALL IN Expert Lessons Learned](https://mattmazur.com/2008/11/18/all-in-expert-lessons-learned/#card_1528792480516_7143)

If you don't mind being relatively unheard of and only want to make enough money to be independent, then it actually isn't very hard to bootstrap a business. It does take time, effort, and a lot of mistake making, but it's like learning anything of value. I think it makes you a stronger and more independent person all around.

Some startups are easier to start but very hard to scale.

Others are very hard to start but easier to scale.

Perversely, early on this can make the good companies look like bad companies, and the bad companies look like good companies.-[Eric Stromberg](https://twitter.com/ericstromberg/status/991015134398042114)

The founders I know who have created great businesses started with a good insight into something a few people wanted, and then survived long enough for many more people to realize they also wanted it.

the startup is nothing more than a teacher. It, in fact, is a great teacher for no other reason than it demands the accumulation of knowledge quickly for the startup to survive.-[The alternative to the four-hour workweek mindset](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/the-alternative-to-the-four-hour-work-week-mindset/#card_1524803765850_4346)

G&G: A hotly debated question in the tech investor community is, “What is the single most important factor for startup success?” Some say it’s the team. Some say it’s the product/market fit. Others say it’s timing. Obviously, all three are important, but if picked one single factor, which would it be?
Chris: I’d say opportunity is the most important. I often meet talented entrepreneurs who put an incredible amount of time and effort into solving problems that ultimately lack real market opportunity.

 Stay focused! Ignore things that are a waste of time: meetups & conferences, meetings with no clear agenda, fundraising if you're not fundraising, reading lots of tech media articles, etc. Every week should feel like significant progress in the first year.

 Growth may be flat for the first 9 months. It's gonna be okay. Almost every company has experienced this: Airbnb had to sell cereal in-between, Slack failed as a gaming company first, Tesla sold only 147 cars after 6 years! You probably won't be an overnight success either.
 
 do customer support yourself. You will learn a lot about why your product sucks. I did 5,000+ support tickets when it was the two of us. Delight customers & fix things fast while you learn. It will help you build an amazing intuition about your customers.
 
 Positioning matters. Spend time figuring out how to explain your product. If it's easy to do, figure out how to explain why it's different as simply as possible. If not, keep experimenting. We bombed this in the first year. It can often be the diff between success & failure.
 
 Don't waste. Ignore status. Focus on building. Make people think you're bigger than you are. Do things the larger company won't do because they move slow. You don't need ping pong tables to win, you need grit & resourcefulness.
 
 Stay laser focused on solving a narrow set of problems. I failed to do this around the 18 mo mark & got behind because shiny new things excited me. It hurt us & we lost customers. We spent the next 2 years focused on 3-4 major things & significantly surpassed our competitors.-[Suhail](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1004042100839628801)

 A common mistake people make is that they focus on trying to achieve viral growth early on. Your 1st few versions of the product are probably bad (our 1st versions were terrible!) & you likely lack the retention needed to sustain viral growth. Focus on making early users happy
 
 This 1st lesson comes hard learned for most engineers: get up — away from your monitor—and talk to your users! I know it’s safer & comfortable to just email people but it’s also easier to ignore you. Your first 100 customers are usually acquired as a result of YOU selling.-[Suhail](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1009454387171692544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Favc.com%2F2018%2F06%2Fsome-words-of-wisdom%2F)
