## System

In modern world, I think we have a pretty old and fixed framework to educate kids, even for adult to educate themselves. We want our kids to absorb the same information and framework as we were. We want them to be “safe” all along the way, because we been there before, we achieved something so we want them have it too. Capitalism enhance this problem, because you use it wisely you can leverage capital to “achieve” more than other people. In all along the way, we create a huge ego too.

We are so so used to compare everything with others, social status, titles, degrees, number of bank account, car, brands…in the end, we are actually playing a game invented by old sociality. We want to win no matter what, we made ourselves overloaded, also made the environment overloaded. And the human beings still want our kids to continue this game.

## Avoid fear

If you have a noise problem is because you have a system that pushes information to yourself faster than you can consume it. No amount of information re-decoration or re-abstraction will solve this problem. This is also the reason why all the social media platforms eventually move away from chronological feeds and start using algorithmic feeds.

The solution is to narrow the scope of information that is useful or relevant to you, but the paradox here is that information systems success come from creating a product that is a solution for FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and not a solution for keeping people informed about what matters.

## Think independently

The advice paradox: THE best performers are often great because they don’t care what people tell them. They are not followers.

Advice on any core issue needs to be thoroughly metabolized before it's useful, IMO. A few times I've regretted taking well-intended advice which was a bad fit for reasons the advisor simply didn't know.
