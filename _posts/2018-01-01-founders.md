1. Mediocre VCs focus on not losing their money, top VCs want you to show them you can invent the future.

2. For you, employee and investor, every opportunity comes with an opportunity cost. Judgement is underrated.

3. If you actually believe something, you try your best to make it happen. It doesn’t always happen, but it happens most of the time.

4. A 90% chance of failure is not a problem if there’s a 10% chance of (earning) 100 times your money.

5. The only people whose advice to an entrepreneur is worth heeding are those who have worked at a startup. And most VCs haven’t done that, so 99.9% they give stupid advice. 

6. Bringing down those personal ego walls and learning from other people.

7. If you want to make a masterpiece, you have to be willing to create a little garbage along the way.

8. Visionaries are people who can see in the dark.
