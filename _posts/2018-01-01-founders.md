1. Mediocre VCs want to see that your company has traction, top VCs want you to show them you can invent the future and never give up.

2. For you, employee and investor, every opportunity comes with an opportunity cost.

3. If you actually believe something, you try your best to make it happen. It doesn’t always happen, but it happens most of the time.

4. A 90% chance of failure is not a problem if there’s a 10% chance of (earning) 100 times your money.

5. The only people whose advice to an entrepreneur is worth heeding are those who have worked at a startup. And most VCs haven’t done that, so usually they give stupid advice. 

6. Bringing down those personal ego walls and learning from other people.

7. Look at big problems as challenges, not as obstacles.

8. If you want to make a masterpiece, you have to be willing to create a little garbage along the way.

9. Startups exist because they aren’t just ideas, they are armies of smart engineers, know how, and culture.
