A startup with one dominant founder is more likely to become an extraordinarily successful company than a startup with an even split.

But of course, the vast, vast majority of startups do not become extraordinarily successful companies. Most fail, and of those that succeed, most are moderately successful.

I wonder what the data is around moderately successful companies. It is more important to me that I raise my chance of being "extraordinarily successful" from .001% to .002% than that I raise my chance of being moderately successful(life-style business) from 20% to 30%.
