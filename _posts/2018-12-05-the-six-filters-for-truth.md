Personal experience (Human perceptions are iffy.)

Experience of people you know (Even more unreliable.)

Experts (They work for money, not truth.)

Scientific studies (Correlation is not causation.)

Common sense (A good way to be mistaken with complete confidence.)

Pattern recognition (Patterns, coincidence, and personal bias look alike.)
