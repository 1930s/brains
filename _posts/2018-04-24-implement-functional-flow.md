## Why do functions matter?

- Functions are a great abstraction. Looking at the input and output values gives you the complete information about the data flow. This makes functions very easy to reason about. Effiency. 

- With the absence of side effects, you also have no unintended side effects, which plague all thoughts which modifies state.

- Functions are easily testable, they do not depend on an environment but just the function parameters.

- For the same input a function necessarily always returns the same result, this also makes reasoning about a mind behavior easier.

- As a consequence that they only depend on their inputs, functions usually are very composeable.

## Flow

Flow isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function.

* Input - the information/functions/brain entered into a flow system. Please check [Brains Issues](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/issues), [Liked Tweets](https://twitter.com/i/likes), [Hacker News Upvoted/Fav](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=allenleein).

* Processing - the process of transforming input information/functions/brain into and output. Please check [⚡️Input-observables](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/labels/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8FInput-observables) and [⚡️Output-observables](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/labels/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8FOutput-observables).
