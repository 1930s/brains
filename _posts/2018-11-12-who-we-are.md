In varying degrees, we are probably all burdened with the delta between who we think we’re supposed to be, and who we actually are.

I’m also not sure I’ll ever understand why so many of us can go years, even decades, trying to quiet an inner voice in order to satisfy an outer force. Only to return — in the best case — to where we started.

For me, my truth is a lot less dramatic than Heath’s. Over the last few years, I’ve found myself returning to the places where I started — steeped in creativity, and writing, and learning. I find myself caring less about impressing others, and more about pushing my own boundaries. I no longer want to be smart — I want to be informed. I don’t need to be admired — I need to be respected. I don’t care about screwing up — I care about not taking risks.

And above all else, I’m not interested in what others think I should be. Rather, I’m committed to continuously becoming who I actually am.
