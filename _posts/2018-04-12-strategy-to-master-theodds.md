## Opportunities: Problems of Companies


> “Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works.” – Jason Zweig.


The opportunity exists in the business world because when companies become successful is when collective leadership becomes most focused on maintaining success. Usually, leadership tends to see more risk in the downside of the current plan and than upside in taking on new things.

Few things companies doing regularly:

1. View a temporary trend as a competitive advantage.
2. Focus on building reputational momentum.
3. Believe it's easy to span across generations.
4. Love being right.
5. Love the new idea, not new way of thinking.
6. Love being "Data-Driven".

Being right and staying right is totally different. Doing well reduces the incentive to explore other ideas, especially when those ideas conflict with your proven business model. 

The idea is not important as thinking. And knowing how your idea evolving is more important to have a good idea. Because you will realize how to generate your own point of view.


## Ignore Competition


> "If you raise the floor of competence, you inevitably lower the ceiling of achievement. There is no reward without risk, and demanding that everything meet a certain standard is to inevitably ensure that nothing goes beyond."- @benthompson

> For most of history,  success meant control of scarce resources. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum.Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things. - Paul Graham


Remember, business models are less durable than they used to be. Experts bad at telling you what you shouldn't do and what you should do.

Usually, the traditional Business Thinking Process is:

1. Dissect the dominant business model in your industry.
2. How big is the remaining market?
3. Find a way to get in.

Instead, in order to master and beat the odds, you should just totally ignore "the market things" and think about:

1. What's the business model other people can't/hard to clone?
2. What's the opportunity cost of building it? 
3. What's your advantage to build that business?  

First, why can you ignore the market? Because Which market does not depend on you, it's on the user. You’re not in the market you think you’re in – you’re in the market your users think you’re in. Most failed companies made the wrong "Awesome product" by choosing the wrong market and following the wrong standard.

If your business fits in a market design by someone else, your dead. Pepsi never catches Coke. Bing never catches Google. The real question is can you design a market that you can dominate. 

Second, market-size is not important at all. Numbers are about the past if you wanna create new things, you need to focus on what's the one that can't be copied and people don't know they need it yet.

If you thinking about market-size, the market you are talking about is old and full of competitors. Market means buyers not a customer segment or existing category.

So. Igore competition, don’t be data-driven. 

Create your own category.
