# Jony Ive 

Apple design head Jony Ive gave a bit of advice to designers who would like to work at Apple during an interview with Charlie Rose.

When asked what he looks for when hiring young designers, Ive replied:

Well there was a time the process would normally be someone would submit a portfolio of work, and that would be reviewed, and we would look very specifically what they did, their designs.

But I've always been more interested in the way people see the world. This is actually a long time ago now, it was probably 9 or 10 years ago. I arrived late, we were interviewing this guy, and I was late, and I didn't want to be rude, so I stood outside the conference room.

I listened to him, not describe his work, but describe the world as he saw it. And there was a sensitivity that was breathtaking, and you could hear a pin drop, and without seeing one drawing, or one model, or anything he had done, decided we must hire this guy.

So to me, it's just how we see the world, and to share that ambition based on an understanding to develop an expertise to sincerely join us in trying to make the very best products that we can for each other.


Ive also mentioned that he takes consumer feedback into consideration. "Very harsh criticism is fundamental to what we do. We figured this out a long time ago, but this has become a very fundamental to our process and how we work," Ive explained.
