# ⚡️Functional Flow

This is an experimental Functional [Flow](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flow_(psychology)) project. I'm trying to turn my brain into an Open-source brains. 

Open-source brains are functional flow with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the brains to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source brains are developed in a collaborative public manner.

Functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function.

* Input - the information/functions/brain entered into a flow system. Please check [Brains Issues](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/issues), [Liked Tweets](https://twitter.com/i/likes), [Hacker News Upvoted/Fav](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=allenleein).

* Processing - the process of transforming input information/functions/brain into and output. Please check [⚡️Input-observables](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/labels/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8FInput-observables) and [⚡️Output-observables](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/labels/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8FOutput-observables).
