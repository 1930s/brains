# Ghosts in the Shell: 

## Brains, Machines and Functional Flow

### ([Essay still in process 30%](https://github.com/functionalflow/brains/projects/11))


Ghost in the Shell (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊 シェルのゴースト) is a 1989 Japanese media franchise originally published as a seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow.

In that post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg. (Wiki)

We are still way far from that kind of individual advanced tech in 2018, though we are slowly becoming the cyborg with a supercomputer in our pocket. With the sheer amount of information available in the world today, we have become overwhelmed. 

Our mind is in a constant racing state.

Inspired by Ghost in the Shell, I believe the future of human thinking is to decentralize ourselves to a network like "GHOSTS in the Shell". I think we should try to turn our brain into composable and functional brains by starting to view everything as a function and iterate it like a machine. 

We need to elevate our mind in this digital age. Not only as human, but also as human + machine.


# Define Functional Flow

Functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function.

## Why Do Functions Matter?

- Functions are a great abstraction. Looking at the input and output values gives you the complete information about the data flow. This makes functions very easy to reason about. Efficiency. 

- With the absence of side effects, you also have no unintended side effects, which plague all thoughts which modifies state.

- Functions are easily testable, they do not depend on an environment but just the function parameters.

- For the same input a function necessarily always returns the same result, this also makes reasoning about a mind behavior easier.

- As a consequence that they only depend on their inputs, functions usually are very composeable.

## What are your functions? (In process)

## Why Do Flow Matter? 

Flow isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Flow, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

In short, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

The “flow experience” is defined by psychology professor Mihály Csíkszentmihályi by six factors:

   1. Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
   2. Merging of action and awareness
   3. A loss of reflective self-consciousness
   4. A sense of personal control over the situation or activity
   5. A distortion of temporal experience, one’s subjective experience of time is altered
   6. Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience 

-[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))

Again, functional flow is the mind state where you can think almost everything as a function.

In Functional Flow theory, building a functional flow system is all about two stages: 

* Clearity and efficiency 

* Flow and composition


## First: A Clear and Efficient Machine 


We need to see things purely.


#### Being Clear

> The most basic definition of clarity is:
> 
> The clarity level between input and output.


Back to the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci simply watched, noted, and contextualized things as he saw fit. It wasn’t like he was intentionally studying science one day and art another. To him, they were one and the same thing. They danced together, and it wasn’t possible to understand one without the other.


#### Being Efficient


> The most basic definition of efficiency is:
> 
> The ratio between input and output.

In the book < The systems approach, Dell Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1968 >, we can view an organization as an organic system, instead of blindly following the traditional lines of a division the management scientist turns to basic "missions" or "jobs" or "activities". 

All these three terms are used to describe the same kind of thing, namely, the rational breakdown of the tasks the system must perform. This is a mission-oriented view of the components of a system that is completely different from the traditional view. 

#### Clear(Efficient)= Machine X


Clear efficiency is looking around one's functional flow to discover if, and in that case - where? When? Why?, inefficiency occurs. These inefficiency can be for example idle idea(output), idle information(input) or idle functions. A good functional flow owner should then do his/her/their best to eliminate these inefficiency. All of this in order to reduce the total cost of operations of the functional flow system.


<p align="center">

</p>

The philosophy behind the efficiency approach to functional flow is based the idea of "the one best way for yourself", i.e., the best way to input information, compute/compose functions, perform tasks, output value as a balanced human being.

If you time every single step and motion, and then carefully design the steps of the task to minimize the time, the system will perform in the best possible way.

This approach leads toward automation of the operations. If we know the optimal way, the only way, we also know how to design a machine or robot to perform the same task. 

Some humanists might be horrified by this, fearing the result will be degradation of one' human dignity and neglect of deeper human values.

I will explain why "flow" and "composition" will easily ease those concerns later. 

Just like the way Leonardo da Vinci see how the world works: They are dancing together.

## Second: A Composable Flow in the Shell


We need to see things purely, as function compostion.

> The most basic definition of Functional Flow is:
> 
> The ratio of function composition between input and output.

</p>


#### Machine (Composable Flow) = Functional Flow

> Winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved.

Although the word "function" has been defined in many ways, everyone will agree that a function can be a set of functions coordinated to output a set of value. 

The flow state isn’t like appearance or success that other people get to rate. It’s more like happiness or curiosity, like creativity.

Functional Flow is the mind state where you can view almost everything as a function. You can take another person's functions (thinking models, paths...) as the input of your function (also could be the input of other people's function). If you want to, after composing, you can also take that as your input again.

In some way, you can say it's like composing people’s thinking models(including yours) and iterate it like a machine.

That's why Functional Flow is all about composing and iterating like GHOSTS in the shell. 

Ghosts as a whole, in the powerful machine.

# Implement Functional Flow

## Iterate Your Machine (In process)


### Environment

Creating the right environment so you can focus, including people. Mastery comes from a combination of the following:

1. Right energy
2. Staying in Flow state and being functional
3. Detected, recovered-from failures
4. Right knowledge
5. Always working slightly beyond your comfort zone

### Right Energy

Usually, you do not have a time problem. You have an energy problem.  The best performer uses energy to get the highest ROI on their work.


<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="400" src="https://i.imgur.com/yfROVvJ.jpg" alt="Sublime's custom image"/>
</p>

Diet and nutrition will be instrumental to your energy/success.  One tiny slip up could cost you the result of imbalance.

### Staying in Flow state and being functional

### Right Knowledge: Knowing that no dogma contains all answers

By and large, every dogma asserts itself as the one with all the answers. Yet, if we look through the lens of history, we see that they each have their successes and their failures. Much of the time, the reason that most of the people who support a particular dogma do so is that of pure chance. Most of them were either born into it or it was the predominant influence around them, which eventually extended itself into their own lives. 

This isn’t necessarily to say that you can’t buy into a belief system that’s supported by a larger framework that many others also see as true. It’s just about thinking with caution. Every culture or ideology has something to teach, but no single one has it all figured out.

The challenge here I think facing the business world is that the human mind has not become any better than it was 1000 years ago, and it's very hard for someone using traditional methods to juggle all the information of the global economy in their head. You can also find that mostly revolutions in one field happen when someone from another field arrives with fresh ideas that developed elsewhere.

### Beyond your comfort zone:  Go get some and be open-minded

What makes somebody fail as a SEAL leader, 99.9% of the time it doesn't have anything to do with their physical skills or their mental toughness, What it has to do with is the fact that the person's not humble enough to accept responsibility when things go wrong, accept that there might be better ways to do things, and they just have a closed mind. They can't change. --- Former Navy Seal Commander

The 10,000-experiment rule means constantly looking for opportunities to collect data rather than just doing what you need to do. It means adding a deliberate reflection process based on reviewing data before the day ends.

Like Sam Altman [said](https://twitter.com/sama/status/975913922891988992):

> You can be wrong on a lot of decisions if you are really right on a few huge ones.  Optimize for the magnitude of your good decisions, not the percentage of the time you are right.

So, you should:

  1. Observing without predefined distinctions 

  2. Questioning the mundane and the obvious 

  3. Experimenting like it’s always a work in progress
