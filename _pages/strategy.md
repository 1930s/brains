# Strategy to Master the Odds 

## Chp. The Shift of Power from Centralized to Decentralized

> Shaking the 500 years of business model

> Both the gap of knowlodge and wealth are expanding

> From centralized to decentralized

From loyalty to empowerment.

From efficient to intelligent.

From ownership to access.

From low cost to no cost.

From human to machine.

> Information is the Power, machine is the leverage

## Chp. Market and Competition

Avoid Competition: business models are less durable than they used to be

> Stop see a temporary trend as a competitive advantage

> Companies are hard to build and even harder to expand across generations

> Which market is not depend on you, its on user

> Competition = Short

> Market Size is not impotant at all

> Timeing is something

> Idea is nothing
