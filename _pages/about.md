# Functional Flow (Open-source brains)

Hi Allen here. This is an experimental Functional [Flow](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Flow_(psychology)) project. I'm trying to turn my brain into an Open-source brains. 

Open-source brains are functional flow with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the brains to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source brains are developed in a collaborative public manner. 


## Components of a Functional Flow System - Input, Process, Output

* Input - the information/functions/brain entered into a flow system. Please check [Brains Issues](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/issues) and [Liked Tweets](https://twitter.com/i/likes).

* Processing - the process of transforming input information/functions/brain into and output. Please check [⚡️Output-observables](https://github.com/allenleein/brains/labels/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8FOutput-observables).

* Output - [Brains](https://allenleein.github.io/brains/).
